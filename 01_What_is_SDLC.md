## ðŸ“Œ What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a structured process followed by software engineers and teams to develop high-quality software in a systematic, efficient, and predictable way.

It outlines each phase involved in the development of software from start to finish.

> Think of SDLC like a roadmap for software projects.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why SDLC is Important?

- âœ… Ensures **clear planning** and understanding of project goals.
- âœ… Helps deliver **high-quality software** within budget and on time.
- âœ… Reduces **risks and errors** by defining structured phases.
- âœ… Encourages **client satisfaction** with well-defined requirements and testing.

Without SDLC, software projects may become disorganized, over budget, or delayed.

## ðŸ”„ Phases of SDLC

### 1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**
- Understand what the client needs.
- Analyze and document requirements.

**Example**: Like understanding the blueprint before building a house.

---

### 2. **Planning**
- Create a project plan and timeline.
- Estimate cost, resources, and scheduling.

**Example**: Planning when and how to build each part of the house.

---

### 3. **Design**
- Create software architecture and design.
- Define database schema, UI/UX, and flow.

**Example**: Designing the interior and layout of the house before construction.

---

### 4. **Development**
- Start writing code based on design.
- Developers build the actual software.

**Example**: Builders construct the house based on the design.

---

### 5. **Testing**
- Verify and validate the software.
- Detect and fix bugs or issues.

**Example**: Inspect the house before handing it over.

---

### 6. **Deployment**
- Deliver the software to users or client.
- Install it in a live environment.

**Example**: Housewarming â€“ the client moves into the finished house.

---

### 7. **Maintenance**
- Fix bugs, make updates or changes after deployment.
- Ensure smooth functioning long-term.

**Example**: Doing regular maintenance on the house like plumbing or repairs.
