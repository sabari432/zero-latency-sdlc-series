# ðŸ“˜ SDLC Models - What, Why & Types

## ðŸ“Œ What are SDLC Models?

SDLC Models are **methodologies or approaches** to follow the Software Development Life Cycle.

Each model provides a different way of organizing the phases of SDLC based on the **project requirements**, **team size**, **timeline**, and **goals**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why SDLC Models are Important?

- âœ… Provides a **structured method** for development.
- âœ… Ensures better **risk management**.
- âœ… Helps teams **stay organized and efficient**.
- âœ… Lets you choose a model that **best fits your project type**.

> Not all projects are the same. SDLC models help adapt the process to different situations.

## ðŸ”„ Types of SDLC Models

### 1. **Waterfall Model**
- Linear and sequential model.
- Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

**Real-life Example**: Building a house step-by-step â€” once the roof is on, you can't go back and change the foundation.

---

### 2. **Agile Model**
- Development happens in **small iterations or sprints**.
- Feedback is collected after each iteration.

**Real-life Example**: Making a sandwich â€“ you taste each layer before moving on.

---

### 3. **V-Model (Validation & Verification Model)**
- Similar to Waterfall, but each development stage has a corresponding **testing phase**.

**Real-life Example**: Assembling a toy and testing each part as it's added.

---

### 4. **Spiral Model**
- Combines Waterfall and iterative development.
- Focuses on **risk analysis** and refinement at each step.

**Real-life Example**: Climbing a mountain â€“ constantly checking weather, gear, and changing your plan as needed.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Choosing the right SDLC model helps in delivering better software based on your **project complexity, team size, and client needs**.

| Model     | Best For                                   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Waterfall | Small, clearly defined projects            |
| Agile     | Evolving projects with active feedback     |
| V-Model   | Projects needing strict validation/testing |
| Spiral    | Large, risky, or complex projects          |
